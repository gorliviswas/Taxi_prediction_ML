Taxi Fare Prediction Using Linear Regression 🚖

This project aims to predict taxi fares based on various factors such as pickup location, drop-off location, and trip distance using Linear Regression. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the fare for a given taxi trip.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python

    Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

    Machine Learning: Linear Regression (Scikit-Learn)

🔍 Project Overview
In this project, I used linear regression to create a model that predicts taxi fares from real-world data. The dataset includes features such as:

Pickup and drop-off locations (latitude and longitude)
Trip distance
Time of day
Passenger count

Steps Involved:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: The data was cleaned, missing values handled, and features were engineered for optimal model performance.

Model Training: I used Linear Regression to train the model on the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation: The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared score.

Model Deployment: The model can be used to predict taxi fares for new trips based on input features.

📊 Results
The model achieved an R-squared score of [insert R-squared score here], indicating [insert interpretation here].

📁 Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/taxi-fare-prediction.git
Install required libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project:

    python taxi_fare_prediction.py
🔧 Usage
After running the model, you can input features like pickup and drop-off locations, trip distance, and time of day to predict the taxi fare.
